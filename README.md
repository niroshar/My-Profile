A Ph.D. in Biostatistics candidate in the Department of Biostatistics, University of Nebraska Medical Center [(UNMC)](https://www.unmc.edu/publichealth/departments/biostatistics/), Omaha, NE. Throughout my academic career, I had opportunity to complete various research projects of data analitics and predictive modelling based on Statistical/Biostatistical, data mining, and machine learning techniques using diffrerent statistical software, RStudio, MATLAB, BayesiaLab, SAS, and SPSS. That motivates me to enhance my knowledge in Data Science field and I have educated myself with data manipulation using SQL, and data visualization using [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/profile/nirosha.p.rathnayake#!/).
 
I have uploaded [R codes](https://github.com/niroshar/My-R-Codes) of some of the research projects I completed during my academic career. The remaining R codes will be posted after the peer review.
