A Ph.D. in Biostatistics candidate in the Department of Biostatistics, University of Nebraska Medical Center [(UNMC)](https://www.unmc.edu/publichealth/departments/biostatistics/), Omaha, NE. Throughout my academic career, I had opportunities to complete various research projects of data analytics and predictive modeling based on Statistical/Biostatistical, data mining, and machine learning techniques using diffrerent statistical software, RStudio, MATLAB, BayesiaLab, SAS, and SPSS [](https://niroshar.github.io/My-Profile/Professional.html). That motivated me to enhance my knowledge in Data Science field and I have educated myself with data manipulation using SQL, and data visualization using [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/profile/nirosha.p.rathnayake#!/). 

I have uploaded *R* codes for some of the research projects I completed during my academic career. Some of them are still under review and will be posted after the peer review.  [This is me in GitHub!](https://github.com/niroshar?tab=repositories)
