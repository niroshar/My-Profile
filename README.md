Currently working as a Data Scientist at Union Pacific Railroad [UP](https://www.up.com/index.htm), a Ph.D. in Biostatistics candidate in the Department of Biostatistics, University of Nebraska Medical Center [(UNMC)](https://www.unmc.edu/publichealth/departments/biostatistics/), Omaha, NE. 

Throughout my [academic career](https://niroshar.github.io/My-Profile/links/Professional.html), I had opportunities to complete various research projects of data analytics and predictive modeling based on Statistical/Biostatistical, data mining, and machine learning techniques using diffrerent statistical software, RStudio, MATLAB, BayesiaLab, SAS, and SPSS. That motivated me to enhance my knowledge in Data Science field and had opportunity to develop univariate and multivariate predictive models using boosted decision trees using RStudio and Python at Union Pacific. I have experience with data manipulation using SQL, and data visualization using [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/profile/nirosha.p.rathnayake#!/).
