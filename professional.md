#### Research Experience 

* Developed a predictive model for assessing pancreatic cancer risk factors using Bayesian 
analysis through information theory learning algorithms using R and BayesiaLab software.

* Developed a model for logistic regression with known random covariates through a 
simulation study using MATLAB software. 		
	                  
* Analyzed data collected from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry, 
adopted conditional survival analysis methods and identified invariant characteristics of 
common gastrointestinal (GI) cancers using R and MATLAB software.

* Developed a method to estimate cancer resistant rate by stratification of gender, and 
geographical area using MATLAB.    

* Exploratory analysis of cancer incidence by age, gender, ethnicity, and state in the US 
considering data extracted from SEER registry during 1973-2012 period using R software.

* Predicted and compared survival estimates of non-small cell lung cancer patients using 
data extracted from National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) based on parametric and nonparametric 
survival methods using SAS and R software.

* Evaluating Random Forest model for survival estimation of non-small cell lung cancer risk 
factors using R software.

* Longitudinal study to assess hearing loss among employees using data from four different 
power plants using R software.   
					
* Creating [word clouds](https://github.com/niroshar/Word-Cloud), document writing using [Rmarkdown](https://github.com/niroshar/My-R-Codes/tree/master/Reproducible-Reports), experience with [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/profile/nirosha.p.rathnayake#!/), SQL, prepare DashBoards using R


#### Academic 

* Held group discussion sessions and graded assignments in Biostatistics II and Correlated 
Data Analysis.

* Actively engaged preparing numerous assignments, answer sheets, held group discussion 
sessions during statistical lab hours, graded students' assignments, and exams in 
Biostatistics I.

* Created pdf version booklets of using SPSS and statistical probability calculator web 
applets.  

* Facilitated group discussion sessions in Biostatistics for Evidence Based Medicine course 
for second year medical students. 
 
* Taught Intermediate Algebra and College Algebra courses for undergraduate students and 
supervised Math Lab discussion sessions.
